i took your advice and packed the kids off to aunt aggie's for a
while i figure there isn't a nazi agent alive that can take her on
and live to tell the tale

i made my excuses in london and am working out of a small office by
the docks in southampton one of the few left standing after the blitz
i have a pilot friend who works the flying boats from here he owes me
a favour and i suspect we may need to move fast by the way it turns
out he knows gordon mitchell they worked together in search and rescue
for a while thought the connection might suggest a few ideas to you
for cipher keys

the latest nazi message we intercepted was a bit of a pig to crack in
more ways than one though once i figured out that it was just a keyword
substitution it fell pretty quickly surprising to find that the nazi
agents seem to be wodehouse fans

in all seriousness i am beginning to fear for kholi's safety the nazis
are ruthlessly exploiting the cult's loyalty to the diamond and this
will i am sure make it difficult for him to recruit any cult members
as agents

have you heard any more from any of our contacts we really do need to
try to figure out what the nazis have in mind should i hit charide on
that flying boat and tail herz-feuer maybe

aunt aggie says hi
