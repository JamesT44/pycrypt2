the boat's radio room has detected signals from the area of the last
sighting. these signals are highly regular in keeping with the
designation of beacon and i assume they are intended as a form of
locator device in a recovery situation. the average depth of the arctic
basin is well beyond the operating depth of this boat, however
triangulating the signal over the last forty eight hours we believe that
the beacon is in shallower water lying over the lomonosov ridge. it is
likely that the leninsky komsomo, a november class boat, can operate at
greater depths than us, but we have the edge on speed and probably on
detectors so we may be able to recover the beacon before they arrive. at
this time of year sea ice cover means that our direct route to the ridge
will take us under the ice through shallow water. the journey will
stress the crew so we need to minimise the distance travelled. we will
continue to monitor the signal. any information you can give us about
location will be greatly appreciated.
