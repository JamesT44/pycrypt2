my dear letzter

i have good news. the agent kholi has been captured and is now being
held at the hydro plant in uttar  pradesh alongside the american
physicist salinen. for now salinen is refusing to cooperate and he
has shown a tiresome degree of courage. we are hoping however that a
recent development may come to our aid. the agent known as charlie
has arrived in bombay and our agents are following her movements.
she appears to be making plans to travel to shirazihind and if we
capture her there we may be able to use her to persuade salinen to
work with us. few of our enemies have the moral courage to watch
someone else suffering for them.

our physicists tell me that their initial calculations suggest that
the device should indeed be capable of producing sufficient energies
for our purpose. with salinen's assistance we are on the brink of a
new dawn. we alone will have the ability to control the power of the
sun here on earth. the reich will be avenged
