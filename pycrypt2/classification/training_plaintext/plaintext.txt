date march 27th 1959
to captain omen
from prof. vandiver
subject intercept

the soviet message contained valuable information and a tantalising clue
concerning the object we are required to recover. the k3 is believed to
be the first serving nuclear powered boat in the soviet fleet and its
captain is an experienced officer. the choice of this boat may indicate
that the soviets intend to stay submersed for some time, and this
confirms my suspicion that they do not have good intelligence concerning
the location of the object. given its apparent designation as a beacon i
am puzzled that there is no signal for us to follow. i would recommend
monitoring the spectrum for unexpected activity near the crash site. our
radio room sent me the enclosed signal which is believed to have been
transmitted by the k3 prior to diving. as you predicted it is encrypted,
but, it appears, only lightly, and i will endeavour to decipher it
quickly. meanwhile i would recommend that we improve security by hiding
the word structure of our messages using the standard 5 letter block
format.
