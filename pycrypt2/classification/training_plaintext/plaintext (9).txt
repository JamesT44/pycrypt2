i have had time to think about the extraordinary accuracy of the
timing signal from the spacecraft and have noticed two features which
set me thinking first the signal is absolute not relative that is there
is some kind of counter yielding a time rather than just a regular
beat this signal is similar to but different from the signal from
the recently launched satellite in space but differs from it very
slightly in trying to account for the difference i realise i was using
newtonian mechanics but maybe we need to use relativity to explain it the
clock in the orbiting satellite seems to be running slowly but maybe that
is a result of time dilation i keep thinking that the timer is the key
to understanding the purpose of these satellites

anyway i broke the last message and have the beginning of a plan the
soviets don't seem to be tracking us too well under water i propose
that we surface out of sight of the weather ship and land our own party
of marines to intercept the beacon we can then submerge and make out
that we are trying to engage the leninsky komosomov as a diversion our
morse transcription machine works well but i adjusted it a little to
cope with the full morse alphabet i seem to have switched one of the
circuits by mistake and the zero now stands for the dot instead of the
dash but it is pretty easy to work with it this way and i think i will
leave it
