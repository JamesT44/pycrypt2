i followed kholi to the nazi hq in uttar pradesh it seems that he has
friends on the inside and he has been able to get messages out to me
the attached report was taken from the desk of the commandant at the
facility and tells us at last what is going on the last sentence is
almost flattering good to know we are getting to them

by the way the encryption fooled me for a while figured it must be
another transposition cipher and it is but boy is it cunning whoever
designed it took the name a bit literally i think any way the key is
to figure out the shape the spacing is very confusing but get rid of
that and count the characters what do you notice i'll leave the rest
to you

could you follow up on this report with your contacts in the states
maybe the guys mentioned townes gordon and zeiger could tell us how
likely it is that the nazis can actually build this device

in the meantime i am making plans for an assault on the labs we have
two objectives of course we need to stop the nazis but we also need
to rescue kholi and his friends i figure having him on the inside is
a big plus if we can coordinate things right i have an idea to destroy
the entire base but i will need quite a large supply of rdx not the
sort of thing you can walk into a hardware store and ask for without
raising a few questions do you have a source for tha there

let me know when you arrive and i will arrange transport and
accommodation near the power station

i suggest replying with a vigenere cipher and keyword of length two
