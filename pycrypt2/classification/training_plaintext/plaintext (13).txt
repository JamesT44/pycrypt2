my time aboard the weather station was interesting to say the least
we obtained photos of the new cipher machine and believe it or not a
full set of wiring diagrams together with the settings for the next
month as far as i know our presence was not detected there was no sign
of life and i guess our diversion worked the low visibility on the ice
helped

the machine i studied was remarkably unsophisticated and bore little
resemblance to the ten-wheel rotor machine our contacts had led us to
expect it may be that as a weather station model it has been kept
simple they may also have been worried that it would fall into enemy
hands and therefore have issued only this prototype nonetheless they
seem convinced of its security time will tell

i will give a fuller report on the structure of the machine its
operation and its current settings in my next message

by the way i found the enclosed plaintext next to the machine and it
looked as though it was about to be sent it may be worth listening out
for the next weather station transmission

in the meantime i will attack the latest soviet message they seem to
have scaled up the security again though i don't think this one uses
the rotor machine so it shouldn't be too steep
