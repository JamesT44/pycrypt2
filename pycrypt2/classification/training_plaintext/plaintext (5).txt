i have been puzzled by certain features of the beacon signal given
the unlikelihood that the beacon would at these latitudes land in
sufficiently shallow water for recovery i am surprised that the
soviet engineers would supply a location device if the beacon was
destined for orbit the additional weight of a locator circuit would
be difficult to justify assuming that the soviets do not want us to
salvage the beacon i wonder why they would place a signalling device
on board which would certainly betray its presence to enemy ships
i figure that rather than playing an auxilliary role the beacon
signal is a main function of the device speaking with the officer
of the watch i learnt that we are passing close to the wreckage of
the launch vehicle i suggest we make a detour for inspection and
analysis one last remark given the surface scattering the signal
from the device is hard to detect but the traces we have found show
that its timing is extraordinarily precise and regular i have no
explanation for this but it is difficult to believe it is a case
of overengineering
