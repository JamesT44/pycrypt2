not best pleased to hear you are now working on the inside at the power
plant how did kholi arrange that from a cell anyway having you both there
is a big plus from the point of view of this operation and i guess i can
live with it you really do seem to have inherited more than your share of
aunt aggie's spirit

i found a supplier for the rdx working on the fringes of the indian military
and he has arranged for a truckload to be delivered to the power plant in
the guise of industrial lubricants no one is going to stick their hand in a
barrel of oil to check it and he claims they can wrap the rdx in something
to protect it i am not sure what you have in mind he tells me the amount you
have asked for could bring down a small mountain but better safe than sorry

my contacts in the us tell me the physicists mentioned in the nazi report
have all been working on some sort of ray beam like in the movies i have no
idea if this can be turned into a serious weapon but whether or not it can
i am not happy to see an organisation like this one get any traction so i
say we should aim to wipe it out in one blow i am hoping that's what you
have in mind too

my main worry is how we get you kholi and salinen out of there safely does
kholi have anyone else he needs to protect

i like this vigenere system but maybe a keyword of length seven would be
better next time

all the best
harry
