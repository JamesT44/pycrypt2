charlie,

the theft of the imperial crown from the white tower last week has shocked the
intelligence community and most of my contacts are lying low, but i made some
enquiries with kholi. i think you met him when we were both in lahore during the
war? he has heard rumours that the ancient cult of the koh i noor twins has been
very active recently and it can't be a coincidence that the crown held the koh
i noor diamond.

i can't believe how na√Øve the german agents are being, if they keep using
these easily cracked ciphers we will be find it pretty easy to keep tabs on
them. this one is a bit tougher but no one is going to lose much sleep over an
affine shift! anyway it says that the nazis really are behind the theft of the
diamond, though i still have no clear idea why!

i am concerned that they know about our involvement watch your back, your
aunt will never forgive me if anything happens to you. i would suggest sending
the kids to the country for a while (though cornwall might not be the best
choice) so you can disappear if you have to.

kholi has infiltrated the cult and will be feeding us more intelligence soon; i
will let you know if i hear anything. harry
