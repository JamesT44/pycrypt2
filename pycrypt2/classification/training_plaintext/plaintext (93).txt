to the leader of the ancient and honourable brotherhood of the koh i noor twins

gracious leader it is the highest honour to be appointed to tell you that the
koh i noor diamond that most precious of all the worlds treasures is to be
returned at last to the safe keeping of the brotherhood my fellow disciples are
travelling even now to your home in uttar pradesh with the treasure in their
safekeeping

as you know it is my deepest wish to be in the presence of the koh i noor twin
while i know that i am not worthy of such an honour i hope with all my heart
that my own part in the restoration of the mountain of light might encourage you
to entertain the possibility of granting this most heartfelt wish

i will myself be travelling to uttar pradesh shortly and look forward to serving
you and the brotherhood in any way i can

your honourable servant
