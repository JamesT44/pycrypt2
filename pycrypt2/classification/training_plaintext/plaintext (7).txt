the divers have returned from examining the wreck of the rocket
there isn't much left and not a lot to tell from what you told them
and what they saw it looks like the second stage of the rocket
failed to separate from the first so there wasn't enough lift to
make orbit when the fuel ran out the whole thing crashed and burned
i guess the beacon was thrown clear the fact that the rocket was
staged must mean it was intended for orbit so your guess that the
beacon is a satellite seems good

while at the surface we pulled in signals from a soviet weather
station on the lomonosov seems to be using the same encryption
systems as the leninsky komsomov and i've told the guys in the
radio room to keep tabs on them when they can

we also spotted a soviet plane patrolling the ice probably a tupole
v ninety-five we call them bears intel say this might be the pritok
variant a prototype for locating landed spacecraft but we didn't think
that was flying ops yet

by the way our cipher guys in the nsa tell us to expect the soviets
to switch to a more secure system they picked up a weather broadcast
using a transposition cipher and reckon the sub may follow suit
