harry

it looks like your plan worked though i'm not sure even i understood
it as you predicted the marine party encountered serious resistance
at the pickup point they brought the hercules in to land during an
engagement with the advanced party of commie naval infantry as you
suggested they faked a direct hit by the enemy on landing and gave
them plenty of time to radio news of the hit back to their base our
marines held the perimeter and wiped out the reds' reconnaissance
team before they could make it to the wreckage of the plane planted
the fake beacon laid charges and blew it all up before evacuating
under heavy fire from the main soviet attack force losses to the
shore party were seven killed and twelve wounded the latter are being
transferred to hospital at spitzbergen for assessment the loss of these
men will be attributed to a training accident

the main force of spetznaz should have explored the remains of the
plane by now the charges on our decoy beacon were large enough that
only a few carefully placed soviet resistors could be left they won't
be able to resist the conclusion that their secrets are safe

our tech boys think you are right the russkies are aiming to set up
a global navigation system based on satellite timing signals i guess
we'll be working on the same thing the real beacon was recovered by
the british sbs party without incident and it is now aboard their
secret new dreadnought nuclear sub en route to rosythwell transfer
it there to a us ship on a routine courtesy call for transport back
stateside i was highly sceptical about using the brits but they came
through in the end

your idea of using the entire us mission as a diversion was tactically
a master stroke not only did we get the satellite but also a lot of
intelligence about the new cipher machine i've enclosed prints of the
photos you took of the machine settings when you were on board the
weather station maybe we can use this to decrypt their transmissions

for a while the only intelligence downside was that we had to move
against the agent wax to shut down any possibility of leaks however
we can use him to feed back useful disinformation for a while of course

i need hardly remind you that this story must never get out however
i wouldn't be surprised if a few intelligence stars and presidential
citations are on their way

sorry to hear you are being transferred back to shore duties it's been
a pleasure having you on board the michael five and i hope we can work
together again some time

all the best
