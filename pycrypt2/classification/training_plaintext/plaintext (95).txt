my dear herz-feuer

your work with the cult is of the first order and our hopes now rest
entirely on finding a suitable power source for the device our agents
have infiltrated the power wing of the central water and power
commission and have begun a systematic and comprehensive study of the
hydroelectric resources in the country their initial estimates suggest
the potential to generate over four thousand megawatts at peak load
assuming only sixty percent efficiency german engineering may well
increase this and i see a happy future for the reich in the indian
subcontinent even now a pilot power plant i nuttar pradesh is
generating enough power for our initial trials with the taschenlampe
project

the enemy agent known to us as kholi has been getting close to our
operations and it may be time to bring him in i will arrange for him
to be held at the power plant until we can interrogate him further

your friend
